> An automatic JSON response validator for testing in Rails

SchemaConformist is an automatic JSON response validator for your API testing in Rails.

This library automatically validates that JSON responses are conformant with the schema. The schema can be described as one of [JSON Hyper Schema](http://json-schema.org/latest/json-schema-hypermedia.html), [OpenAPI 2.0](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/2.0.md) and OpenAPI 3 (currently [3.0.2](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification/blob/master/versions/3.0.2.md) is latest).

This library uses [Committee](https://github.com/interagent/committee) to validate JSONs.

## Usage

### Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'schema_conformist'
```

and execute `bundle install`.

Configure `schema_path` as follows (ex. using an OpenAPI 3 schema):

```ruby
Rails.application.config.schema_conformist.schema_path = Rails.root.join('doc', 'openapi.yaml')
```

That's all. Then all JSON responses in integration-test/request-spec are validated according to your schema.

### Writing the Schema

Write your API schema in one of JSON Hyper Schema, OpenAPI 2 and OpenAPI 3.

See [`test/dummy`](https://github.com/kymmt90/schema_conformist/tree/master/test/dummy) app for examples.

### Configuration

Configuration options are following:

- `schema_conformist.schema_path`
  - Required. The path where the schema is placed
- `schema_conformist.ignored_api_paths`
  - Optional. The array of API paths not to validate. Each path can be described in String literal (used for prefix search) or regular expression.
